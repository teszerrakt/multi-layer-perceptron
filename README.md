# Multi Layer Perceptron from Scratch Using Python
This is an implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptron on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition">Flower Recognition</a> dataset by Alexander Mamaev.
The dataset actually have 5 classes and a total of 4,242 images of flowers, but we only use 3 classes (i.e., daisy, rose, and tulip) and 100 images for each class due to limited computational power.
